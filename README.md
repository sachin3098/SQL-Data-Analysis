# SQL-Data-Analysis<br>
ðŸ‘‰SQL is the language used to interact with relational databases.<br>
ðŸ‘‰Since most systems today capture the data using one or more databases (like MySQL, Oracle, Redshift, SQL Server, etc.).<br>
ðŸ‘‰you need to know SQL to extract data from these systems and then work with it.<br>

To Improve my skills,I write different SQL queries to fetch require data.<br>

**Situation:**<br>
The company has been experiencing a high turnover rate for the past few years, and management is concerned about the costs associated with high attrition.<br>
They decide to conduct a data analysis project to identify the factors that contribute to high turnover and develop strategies to improve employee retention.<br>

**Task:**<br>
To extract relevant information and create meaningful insights using SQL.<br>

**Action:**<br>
1)Load SQL extension in Jupyter notebook.<br>
2)Connect MySQL database to Jupyter notebook.<br>
3)Check the dimensions of the dataset like no.of rows and columns.<br>
4)Check for null value using SQL.<br>

**Result:**<br>
Here are some meaningful insights:<br>

1) Research and development (R&D) Have the Highest attrition rate.<br>
2)Male employees have a High attrition rate in R&D.<br>
3) Those whose educational background is Life science have a high attrition rate.<br>
4) R&D department employees have Good performance ratings but they don't receive promotions in the last 4 years.<br>
5) Employees with one year of experience have a high attrition rate.<br>
6) R&D department has the highest number of people who give 1 star in Environment satisfaction.<br>
7) R&D Department has a high attrition rate in Laboratory technician Roles.<br>
8) Over-Time is one of the factors for the high attrition rate in R&D.<br>
